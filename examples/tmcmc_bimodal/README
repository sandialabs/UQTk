tmcmc_bimodal example


contains example for sampling of 3-dimensional bimodal posterior probability density using TMCMC. The C++ libraries are called directly from the driver program.
By changing the likelihood function and the prior function in bimodal.cpp, this program can be tailored to other inference problems.

tmcmc_bimodal.py: main scripts

tmcmc_bimodal.cpp: C++ code that produces some of the needed functions - 
							sets up the MCMC class object, specifying the
							dimensionality of the problem, number of
							samples required, number of processes for
							parallel evaluation of likelihood and prior

bimodal.cpp: C++ code for evaluating the likelihood and prior pdfs - 
							the corresponding executable is invoked
							multiple times for parallel evaluation
							of likelihood and prior pdfs

tmcmc_prior_samples.dat: samples from prior pdf (as required by TMCMC) - 
							3D Normal prior for this example with 5000
							samples

tmcmc_getLL.sh: Shell script that spawns multiple processes for parallel
							evaluation of likelihood function
tmcmc_getLP.sh Shell script that spawns multiple processes for parallel
							evaluation of prior PDF
tmcmc_moveIntermediateFiles.sh: Shell script used for moving all
							artifacts of TMCMC into a subdirectory
