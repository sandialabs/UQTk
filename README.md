# Uncertainty Quantification Toolkit (UQTk) version 3.1.1

#### Bert Debusschere, Cosmin Safta, Katherine Johnston, Kenny Chowdhary, Khachik Sargsyan, Luke Boll, Mohammad Khalil, Prashant Rai, Tiernan Casey, Xiaoshu Zeng

## Overview
The UQ Toolkit (UQTk) is a collection of libraries and tools for the
quantification of uncertainty in numerical model predictions. Version
3.1.1 offers Polynomial Chaos Expansions to represent random variables,
intrusive and non-intrusive methods for propagating uncertainties through
computational models, tools for sensitivity analysis, methods for sparse
surrogate construction, and Bayesian inference tools for inferring parameters
and model uncertainties from experimental data.

## Documentation
For documentation on how to install and use UQTk, please refer to the manual,
which is included as a PDF file in the directory doc/UQTk_manual.pdf. For more
detailed documentation on the actual source code for development purposes,
please refer to the doxygen documentation in the directory doc/doxy or
[online at https://www.sandia.gov/UQToolkit/doc/](https://www.sandia.gov/UQToolkit/doc/). If you are
familiar with UQTk and would like just a high level overview of where to find
everything and how to install, see the sections on Directory Structure and
Installation below.

## Directory Structure
On a high level UQTk is organized as follows:
* config: Example CMake configuration scripts
* cpp/lib: Core C++ libraries
* cpp/app: Standalone apps that make UQTk functionality available to the command line
* cpp/tests: CMake Unit Tests
* dep: Third party libraries that UQTk depends on
* examples: short tutorial style examples that illustrate key UQTk capabilities
* PyUQTk: Python wrappers for the core C++ libraries as well as additional Python tools

In many key directories, README files have been included to further lay out the
contents of their subdirectories.

## Capabilities
Below is a list of key UQTk capabilities, along with examples that illustrate those
capabilities:
* Intrusive Forward UQ: examples/ops (C++), examples/surf_rxn/SurfRxnISP.cpp (C++)
* Non-Intrusive Forward UQ: examples/surf_rxn/SurfRxnNISP.cpp (C++), examples/fwd_prop (Python),
  examples/window (Python), examples/uqpc (Command Line/Python)
* Non-Intrusive Surrogate Construction: examples/uqpc (Command Line/Python)
* Bayesian Compressive Sensing (BCS): examples/pce_bcs (C++)
* Global Sensitivity Analysis: examples/uqpc (Command Line/Python), examples/pce_bcs (C++), examples/sensMC (Command Line)
* Bayesian Inference: examples/line_infer (C++), examples/iuq (Command Line/Python), examples/polynomial (Python)
* Bayesian model selection: examples/polynomial (Python)
* Transitional Markov chain Monte Carlo (TMCMC): examples/tmcmc_bimodal (C++/Python/Command Line)
* Karhunen-Lo√®ve decompositions: examples/kle_ex1 (C++)
* Data Free Inference (Inference based on summary statistics): examples/dfi (C++)
* Forward Propagation with Basis Adaptation: examples/d_spring_series (Python)
* Numerical Integration (Quadrature): examples/num_integ (Python)

For more details on these capabilities, please refer to the UQTk manual in PDF format.

## Installation
To install UQTk, first create a build directory outside of the UQTk repository.
From within the build directory, configure the distribution via CMake. See example
CMake configuration scripts in the directory config
Then build via ``make``, and test with ``ctest``. Install with ``make install``
For example:
```shell
mkdir build
cd build
../config/config-gcc-Python.sh
make -j 8
ctest
make install
```

For more details, please refer to the UQTk manual in PDF format.
